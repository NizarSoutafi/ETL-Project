# This is a Practice Project
# For this practice project, i used the weather data package provided by the open source project wttr.in, a web service that provides weather forecast information in a simple and text-based format.

I created an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecast and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis.
For each day at noon (local time), I gathered both the actual temperature and the temperature forecasted for noon on the following day for Casablanca, Morocco.
